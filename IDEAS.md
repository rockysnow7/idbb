# The Expos Needed Funding

## premise

- the expos secured funding from rorzagoth, an interdimensional demon
- the expos' stadium is now rorzagoth's domain, so they get certain demon powers during home games
- the expos must make it through the season and postseason to try to win the world series

## gameplay loop

the player is the home commentator for the expos, describing the game in real time.

1. before each game, the player selects the batting order and starting pitcher
2. during the game, the player makes strategic and narrative decisions for each half-inning
3. after the game, the player can perform rituals to increase rorzagoth's goodwill

## in-game choices

general choices:

- sacrifice an out to gain favors
- spend favors to use a demon power

offensive choices:

- swing/take/bunt
- attempt steal

defensive choices:

- where to aim the pitch
- how to throw the ball between fielders

## demon powers

the player may spend favors to use a demon power. the higher rorzagoth's goodwill, the greater the chance that the power will lead to a positive outcome for the expos.

- ?: summon a portal to move the ball mid-flight
    - good outcome: the ball is moved to a more advantageous position
    - bad outcome: the ball is moved to a more disadvantageous position
- mirrorball: the batter sees many copies of the ball flying towards him and must choose which one to hit
    - good outcome: the opposing batter strikes out
    - bad outcome: the opposing batter hits a home run
- time warp: try to rewind to the start of the half-inning
    - good outcome: rewinds to the start of the half-inning
    - bad outcome: skips to the end of the half-inning, with a bad outcome for the expos
- possession: give rorzagoth control of a particular player
    - good outcome: the player plays well for the expos (if an expos player, the player plays perfectly; if an opposing player, the player plays as bad as possible)
    - bad outcome: the player plays poorly for the expos (if an expos player, the player plays as bad as possible; if an opposing player, the player plays perfectly)
    - (a perfect batter will bat .666)
- i me mime: invisible walls are placed around all the opposing players, so they cannot move; they look like mimes/clowns

## between-game rituals

the player may perform rituals between games to increase rorzagoth's goodwill.

- prayer: small increase in goodwill
- blood sacrifice: kill a player; large increase in goodwill
